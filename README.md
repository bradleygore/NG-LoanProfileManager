My first foray into working with AngularJS


8/16/2013 - Bradley Gore

Over the last few months I've been really digging into javascript.  I'm primarily a "back end" dev, but I've come to really love javascript and want to know it well and not just how to use abstraction libraries.

About 5 months ago I built an app using knockout.js that compiles a single loan amortization schedule and allowed for single extra payments on each month as well as recurring extra payments that could span multiple months/years.  However, there were some things I didn't like about that app, and a lot of it may have been my "newb" status with js, so I decided to attempt to write it better but try Angular this time.

I've been very happy with how Angular works, and with not having to wrap up my objects in wrappers to use them in view binding.  I love the easy to use routing, the separation of behaviour/markup/models, the MVC implementation, and the power of custom filters.  Also, I honestly just picked up on this framework easier than I did knockout.  For instance, writing custom directives and filters made sense to me, while doing advanced things with knockout required "unwrapping" observables and such that I honestly had a hard time grocking at the time.

At the time of this writing, I have this app running here: http://gore-guardian.hopto.org

Feel free to make this better, and please remember that I'm still learning :)
